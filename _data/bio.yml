# Biographical sketch

- bio:
  content: I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Technology, Dhirubhai Ambani University (formerly DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, Canada, where I collaborated with an industry partner on conversational recommendation systems. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University College Cork, Ireland (2020), an M.Tech. in Computer Science from the LNM-IIT, Jaipur (2015), and a B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur (2009). <br><br> My research focuses on the design and development of next-generation information systems that are adaptive, explainable, and socially impactful. My interests lie in building advanced recommender systems that incorporate user context and preferences, transforming raw data into actionable insights through decision support systems, and creating AI-driven tools to empower both citizens and policymakers in understanding and analyzing public policies. Broadly, my work lies at the intersection of human-centered artificial intelligence and data-informed decision intelligence, with an emphasis on driving societal benefits through intelligent and responsible system design.
