# Biographical sketch

- bio:
  content: I am an Assistant Professor at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, Canada, where I collaborated with an industry partner on conversational recommendation systems. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University College Cork, Ireland (2020), an M.Tech. in Computer Science from the LNM-IIT, Jaipur (2015), and a B.E. in Computer Science from the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur (2009). <br><br> My research lies at the intersection of Recommender Systems, Multimodal Learning, and Applied Machine Learning. I focus on building intelligent recommendation models that incorporate human-centric factors such as attention, perception, understanding, and decision-making. A key aspect of my work involves evaluating the real-world impact of these systems through A/B testing and online user studies. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in exploring how AI and machine learning can drive digital innovation and transformation across industries.
