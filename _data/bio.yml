# Biographical sketch

- bio:
  content: I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Before joining DA-IICT, I completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Toronto, Canada, where I collaborated with an industry partner on conversational recommendation systems. <br><br> My research lies at the intersection of Recommender Systems, Multimodal Learning, and Applied Machine Learning. I focus on building intelligent recommendation models that incorporate human-centric factors such as attention, perception, understanding, and decision-making. A key aspect of my work involves evaluating the real-world impact of these systems through A/B testing and online user studies. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in exploring how AI and machine learning can drive digital innovation and transformation across industries.
